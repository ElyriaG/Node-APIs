This here is an app that runs in Node. In your terminal, run "node liri.js" followed by either "spotify-this", "concert-this", or "movie-this" and a song title, band, or movie title. If a search term is not included, it will search through the text file by default. If a song title, band, or movie title is not included then it will search a default term.
